# Stellar evolution models for Praesepe

Stellar evolution models computed using the Dartmouth stellar evolution code 
with physics as described in Feiden (2016, A&A, ). The models are computed 
with metallicities that bracket the measured metallicity for Praesepe and
are part of a project characterizing a low-mass eclipsing binary in Praesepe
discovered by K2.
